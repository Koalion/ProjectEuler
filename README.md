# ProjectEuler

Repository with solutions for Project Euler questions. All the questions can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/archives

There are few assumptions for how those questions are solved:
- Code is written in form of function to allow for later reuse (e.g. after doing question with prime number generation and next questions use is this as a first step of the algorithm)
- Project Euler guidelines suggests that the code should execute under the minute - and that is the assumption when further optimizing those functions
